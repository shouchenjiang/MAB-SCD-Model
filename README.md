1. Introduction
In the school education scenario, Teachers and students are the main actors in the process of teaching and learning implementation of school subject curricula. Correspondingly, the curriculum provides a structured framework for teacher teaching and student learning. The MAB-SCD (Multi-Agent-Based Student Cognitive Development) simulation model represents a sophisticated endeavor tailored to comprehensively encapsulate the dynamic intricacies of students' cognitive structures throughout school curriculum instruction. Firmly grounded in the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) cognitive architecture, MAB-SCD distinguishes itself by seamlessly incorporating theories of Cognitive Diagnostic Assessment.
The hallmark of this model lies in its distinctive capacity to dynamically simulate the evolutionary trajectory of students' cognitive structures over time. This simulation unfolds as a dynamic process, intricately mirroring the learning journey of students within the educational context. An integral aspect of its functionality is the meticulous accumulation of information essential for the completion of learning tasks or the attainment of specific educational goals.
2. Other notes
   The Master branch folder includes two additional data files containing students' midterm and final exam answer records, which are used for model calibration and validation. It's important to note that the shared test projects are primarily designed for simulation tests on 16 cognitive attributes related to rational numbers. For model validation, the input modules of the model must be reconfigured based on the "instructional content" and "test content" from the historical data.
