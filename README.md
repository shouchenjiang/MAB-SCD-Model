1. Introduction
In the school education scenario, Teachers and students are the main actors in the process of teaching and learning implementation of school subject curricula. Correspondingly, the curriculum provides a structured framework for teacher teaching and student learning. The MAB-SCD (Multi-Agent-Based Student Cognitive Development) simulation model represents a sophisticated endeavor tailored to comprehensively encapsulate the dynamic intricacies of students' cognitive structures throughout school curriculum instruction. Firmly grounded in the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) cognitive architecture, MAB-SCD distinguishes itself by seamlessly incorporating theories of Cognitive Diagnostic Assessment.
The hallmark of this model lies in its distinctive capacity to dynamically simulate the evolutionary trajectory of students' cognitive structures over time. This simulation unfolds as a dynamic process, intricately mirroring the learning journey of students within the educational context. An integral aspect of its functionality is the meticulous accumulation of information essential for the completion of learning tasks or the attainment of specific educational goals.

2.1 Define System Boundaries
In the realm of secondary school subjects, the initiation of new learning primarily occurs through teacher-led lectures in the classroom. Additionally, students engage in independent learning to reinforce their mastery of acquired knowledge and review areas where further understanding is needed. This independent learning serves the overarching goal of consolidating subject knowledge. The process of making connections is predominantly evident within specific subjects. It involves linking core knowledge within a subject and establishing connections between the teaching sequences implemented by the teacher and the overall structure of the curriculum and associated tasks. This interconnectedness facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter and enhances the overall learning experience for students. Consequently, our study delves into these nuanced processes to gain insights into the dynamic nature of learning in secondary school subjects.
2.2 Identify and Define Agents
In the MAB-SCD framework, four distinct types of Agents are defined to comprehensively simulate the dynamic changes in students' cognitive structures and knowledge acquisition over time, particularly within a semester or an extended duration.
(1) Curriculum Agent
In accordance with the Cognitive Diagnostic Assessment (CDA) theory, we have conceptualized the Curriculum Agent. As depicted in Table 1, the static attributes of the Curriculum Agent primarily consist of three characteristics, denoted as C1~C3. Notably, C1 signifies the teaching content associated with a set of core concepts in the curriculum during the teaching stage of a particular subject. For instance, it may encapsulate the core knowledge concepts designated for instruction in the seventh-grade mathematics curriculum. The specific determination of curriculum content draws guidance from authoritative curriculum standards and real-world school teaching scenarios. Each element in C1 corresponds to the term Cognitive Attribute in the CDA, which is used to denote the knowledge, skills, and strategies that students are expected to acquire in a given course that are covered by the subject at that stage (Leighton et al., 2004; Tatsuoka, 2013). The breadth of content contained in each element corresponds to the Attribute grain size terminology in CDA, and the specific settings should be adjusted according to the actual learning situation and the teacher's teaching strategies.
C2 reflects the hierarchical relationships between attributes. As the core concepts involved have a clear organisational structure, the hierarchical relationships between attributes in the cognitive developmental approach are defined as a specific delineation of the links between identified cognitive attributes. 
C3 indicates the course's teaching or student learning objectives. Using curriculum standards and expert guidance, the alignment between academic achievement levels and knowledge attributes students should master serves as an evaluation criterion for assessing students' academic progress in the course.
The Curriculum Agent involves the behaviour B1, which functions to generate all the ideal attribute mastery patterns. This process is based on input lists of knowledge concept attributes and the hierarchical structure they form, represented by Adjacency and Reachability Matrices.
(2) Teacher Agent
Research in educational psychology suggests that the teacher plays a fundamental and active role in the teaching process since he has the responsibility of the rhythm, content and sequence of the lecture (Ormazábal,2021). 
Hence, for the Teacher Agent in the MAB-SCD model, our focus lies on two static attributes, C4 and C5. C4 represents the subject matter taught by the teacher during the course, while C5 outlines the teacher's teaching schedule. Following the principles of Cognitive Diagnostic Assessment (CDA), cognitive attributes are derived from core concepts, and their operation is not entirely independent; they may exhibit a mental order, logical sequence, or hierarchical relationship. Consequently, the teacher's content and teaching activities should align with these requirements. In this context, C4 represents a topological sequence conforming to hierarchical relationships between attributes. On the other hand, C5 delineates the teacher's lecture plan and content over a specific time period, measured in days. The lectures encompass pedagogical content corresponding to the attributes in C1, and their overall sequence is based on C4.
The behaviour of the Teacher Agent specifically consists of two dynamic decisions labeled B2 and B3. They represent the teacher's actions of selecting the content for the current lecture and delivering a new lesson, respectively. 
(3) Student Agent
The static attributes of the Student Agent encompass four main components (C6~C9). C6, representing cognitive ability, is considered an individual characteristic linked to students' academic achievement(Rohde & Thompson，2007; Tikhomirova, Malykh & Malykh, 2020). In this context, cognitive ability refers to the capacity for cognitive processing and the intellectual foundation that students possess within the school program.
C7 signifies the maximum number of knowledge points a student can review, establishing an upper limit on the selection of knowledge attributes during each review. C8 reflects the student's evolving mastery of all knowledge concepts throughout the course of study. C9 encapsulates the student's pattern of mastering course knowledge, encompassing the acquired knowledge attributes and adhering to the hierarchical structure established between these attributes. Furthermore, the integration of C9 and C3 enables the determination of the student's learning trajectory and academic level.
The behaviors of the Student Agent encompass B4-B6, where B4 involves students learning new knowledge through the instructor's lecture setting; B5 is the re-learning of knowledge attributes that were not mastered in lectures through independent learning, and B6 entails reviewing mastered knowledge attributes for knowledge consolidation.
(4) LTM Agent
In order to accurately model the intricate process of students' knowledge acquisition, involving precise simulation of storage and forgetting events in the human brain. This study integrates insights from the Long-Term Memory (LTM) framework proposed by Chiriacescuand his team(2013). This conceptual framework provides valuable insights into the structure of human long-term memory based on ULM, serving as a reference for modeling a student's ability to manage learned knowledge concepts within the course.
The LTM Agent encompasses three static attributes, denoted from C10 to C12. C10 sets the maximum duration for a knowledge attribute to undergo decay in long-term memory. In essence, if students opt not to revisit a knowledge attribute beyond the specified C10 value, it is presumed that the strength of their memory for that particular knowledge point will diminish over time.
C11 constitutes the set of knowledge attributes in the long-term memory, representing a dynamically changing subset of C1. It reflects which of the knowledge points taught in the course a specific student has presently mastered. C12, on the other hand, is a subset of C2 that records the relationships between the knowledge attributes mastered by a student.
The behavior of the LTM Agent, labeled as B7, encompasses management operations on long-term memory. Specifically, these operations include adding, modifying, and deleting concept attributes stored in the LTM.
